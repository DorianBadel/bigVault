*[[Centralized Database Systems]]* - Built to run on a single physical machine. Can support more than tens of thousands of users and a database sizes ranging from megabytes to hundreds of gigabytes.

*Parallel database systems* - developed, in 1980s, to execute tasks in parallel on a large number of machines to support high-end enterprise applications.

*[[Parallel and Distributed Storage|Parallel data storage systems]]* - designed to store and retrieve data based on keys. They provide very limited support for transactions and they lack support for declarative querying. Can be ran in parallel on very large numbers of machines.

*Distributed database system* - developed to satisfy the need of executing [[Distributed Query Processing|queries]] and update transactions across multiple databases.
